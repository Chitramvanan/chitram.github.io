          Portland Housing Emergency Outreach and Community Safety Web-app
        </h1>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to provide resources for Portland
          residents that are experiencing or are vulnerable to experiencing
          issues relating to homelessness. Allows users to identify their
          location to see nearby homeless shelters, shelters for domestic
          violence victims, woman, and children. <br /><br />
          The app connects them with community resources that provide access to
          essential resources such as food, shelter, clothing, toiletries, etc.
          It also has community boards/forums where other people can connect and
          share community-based information relating to issues of poverty,
          homelessness, safety, or other community concerns.<br /><br />
          This project used Django and Python 2.7 for implementation. It is also
          setup to be readily run with Docker containers.<br /><br />

          Extracting Significant Website Key Objects: A Semantic Web Mining
          Approach
        </h2>
        <p>
          The main objective is to use semantic web mining techniques to
          retrieve and extract the most relevant data and keywords from the web
          pages by breaking the various tags in the web pages and parsing their
          contents. This helps improve search engine efficiency and thereby
          displaying the most relevant pages to the user.<br /><br />
          The project includes these components - HTML Parsing, Tag Extraction,
          Content Extraction and Keyword extraction.
